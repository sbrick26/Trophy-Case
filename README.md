#Welcome to Trophy Case

Trophy is a web application hat allows a user to easily track and sort their projects, awards, and other resume elements for easy copy and pasting into their resume when applying for jobs/internships/etc. As a growing developer, the amount of projects one has increases over time and becomes hard to keep track. Using this website, you should be able to upload crucial information about projects/awards in an easy to read format that can be sorted and exported to your own resume, saving users time on retyping and refactoring resume elements.
