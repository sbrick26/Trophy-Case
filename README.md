# Welcome to Trophy Case

Trophy is a web application hat allows a user to easily track and sort their projects, awards, and other resume elements for easy copy and pasting into their resume when applying for jobs/internships/etc. As a growing developer, the amount of projects one has increases over time and becomes hard to keep track. Using this website, you should be able to upload crucial information about projects/awards in an easy to read format that can be sorted and exported to your own resume, saving users time on retyping and refactoring resume elements. 

## Web App Overview:

### User Home Page: 

The main page allows users to easily view all their uploaded projects in a simple format, add a new "trophy" to your case, and edit/delete an already uploaded trophy. There is also an option to pull up an enlarged view of any particular trophy. The main page will always upload saved trophies from MongoDB, so you will not have to worry about your tophies being lost!
